Scala Laboratory work 2. Data processing from external sources

Formulation of the problem:

  News are read from RSS feeds. The list of channels is formed on its own, based on the subject
areas in an individual task (Table 1). You can request a query containing a key to the news list
word: the term, surname, name of the country, etc.

By this request, news messages are indexed: searches for the number of repetitions of a keyword in the description of each message.

Result: The query produces the top 10 news sorted by increasing the number of repetitions.
